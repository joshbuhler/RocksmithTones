RocksmithTones
==============
Inspired by [WillerZ's work][willerz], I thought it would be a great idea to have a repository of tones/patches/presets available to use with the Rocksmith games. I personally use a Line 6 HD500X and a Fender Mustang III amp, so any tones that I contribute will be for these pieces of gear. (The Fender is pretty much only used as a speaker cab though.)

# Project Setup
Tones will be grouped by the gear they're compatible with. At the moment, there is only one folder, `HD500X`. I'll add more tones as I clean them up. Right now, this is more of a placeholder.

# Tone/Patch/Preset Structure
These presets are heavily based on WillerZ's, the main difference that I've made is that I don't have a Variax guitar, so I've tweaked them to use a regular guitar as input. Other than that, they're practically identical. The first block in the patch is the FX Loop, with the mix set to 0%.

The presets that I've posted so far are based on the tones in Rocksmith 2014. I've loaded the tones in Tone Designer, and tried my best to replicate them in my gear. Some are close, others need quite a bit of work to get closer.

# TODO
 * Finish the readme
